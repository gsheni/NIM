# Nim
A Prolog program that implements the game of Nim.

A human plays against the computer.  
You can say who goes first by what you give as the first input to the game (0 for human and 1 for computer).  
The computer can choose a move in whatever why you want it to (e.g., choosing the first legal move it encounters). 

The game can begin with a query like this:

nim([7], 0).

You can put any odd number in the brackets, and you can start with 0 or 1 (human or computer).
